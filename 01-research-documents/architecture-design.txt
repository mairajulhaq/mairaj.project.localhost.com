=========== End - Architecture Design   ==================

write 'Architecture Design' according virtual university of pakistan for my final year project
which i have created by using following stack.

FrontEnd:
I have utilized 'https://pro.ant.design/' which ready to use admin templates and it is pre configured UMIjs + ant Design pro-components
so that means all protected routes which will be accessable to the loggedin user, teacher, admin are managed in the UMIjs config and
each protected route is rendering the associated UI compoenent and fetch or process data by using backend MVC framework laravel APIs.

Backend:
I have created APIs to manage the following DB tables data in my aaplication and each API route is configured
 by laravel recommeded API route controller structureed controller to inser, update, delete, get, get all routes etc.
 and i have also configured just two views one is frontpage/home-page view which is laravel blade HTML content view.
 the second view is UMIjs view which is rendering for the other all routes expect the main/home/domain page route and 
 it is rendering the UMIjs route associated UI compoenent.
Note: I have utilized 'laravel/sanctum' for API authentication.
